SLAM+
====

**SLAM+** : **SLAM+** or **SLAMplus** is derived from **SLAM** [3], a language independent software dedicated to the data-driven melodic annotation of speech corpora. In comparaison to **SLAM**, there are 2 extensions we introduce in **SLAM+**:
1) Support for **Praat PitchTier** file (in addition to **WAVE** file) as audio input.
2) Two (instead of one in **SLAM**) stylization based on two intonational registers: *global* and *local registers*.

Note: 
1. **SLAM+** is compatible with **Python 2 and 3** but optimized only for Linux distributions.
2. **SLAM+** support **mono-channel WAVE** files and binary and short text **PitchTier** as input source.

## How to install **SLAM+**
0) Download or clone [**SLAMplus**](https://github.com/vieenrose/SLAMplus/tree/dev) and [**swipe-installer**](https://github.com/vieenrose/swipe-installer) and put them in the same repository.

1) Install *Swipe* module (only necessary if you want also to read **WAVE** files in addition to **PitchTier** files)

Implemented by Kyle Gorman, [Swipe](http://ling.upenn.edu/~kgorman/c/swipe/) is a pitch estimation algorithm [1], which is required for **SLAM+** to work with **WAVE** files. Sources of swipe are provided in the swipe-installer directory. These are **slightly modified versions** different from the official *GitHub* release. Modifications are only for the purpose of *Swipe* compiling under *C89* instead of *C99* standards.
  
2) Install the following libraries required by **SLAM+**:

            sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
  
## How to Use **SLAM+**
1) Drop your **mono-channel WAVE** (or **PitchTier**) files and **TextGrid** files in the sub-directory *data* of the corresponding **SLAM** directory. **WAVE** (or **PitchTier**) files must come in pair of *the same name* with **TextGrid** files. As an example: 

     "myfile1.PitchTier" "myfile1.TextGrid" "myfile2.wav" "myfile2.TextGrid"

2) Open a terminal and go to the **SLAM** directory
3) Execute

        python SLAM.py

4) Follow the instructions.

## How to Configure **SLAM+**
You can open SLAM.py and modify the parameters to suit your needs.
